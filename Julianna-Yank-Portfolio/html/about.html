                            <h2>I am a product designer and a graduate from Hunter College.</h2>
                            <p>I am a product designer based in New York City. In my most recent role, I worked as a product designer for a lesbian dating app company called LetzB. I had the honor of designing an entire dating app in a span of about three months. Before that, I was working for one of Shanghai's SHIAF award winning digital marketing companies ASAP+/C+. In this role, I helped them with their UX/UI of WeChat mini programs, as well as redesigning their entire website which increased user engagement by 200%.</p>
                            <p>Through my experience, I discovered that I am most fulfilled collaborating with multidisciplinary teams to develop visually appealing and intuitive products that increase satisfaction and user engagement. My dedication, attention to detail and problem solving skills have allowed me to contribute to the community in meaningful and productive ways.</p>
                            <p>Currently I am in search of my next exciting role!</p>

                            <h3><strong>Love at First Sketch</strong></h3>
                            <p>Growing up I have always had art as a huge influence in my life thanks to my mother. She grew up teaching photography as a part of her life, and so therefore I would say art has always been one of my favorite subjects at aschool. Since I was a young girl, I was always a lover of technology, so in college, I thought I wanted to go for something like computer science. I quickly realized that computer science was not the route I wanted to take because of all the math required. I started to feel hopeless in figuring out what I wanted to do in life. Little did I know, Hunter College offered web design and graphic media courses under the New Media major track. Finally, I found something that satiated both my love for art and technology!</p>
                            <p>Fast forward a few years, I landed the first internship related to my major, at a company called Radiate. For those who do not know this wonderful application, Radiate connects people who attend music festivals together! While working for this company, I was introduced to UX/UI design and IMMEDIATELY fell in love!</p>
                            <p>I loved everything about the design process! Starting with user research, all the way to the hand off stage everything about it sparked my interest! I remember the first time using Sketch to redesign and edit certain mobile screens and the excitement that flooded my body. I was thrilled that I discovered a career that I was truly passionate about!</p>
                            <p>In a way, I have radiate as a company to thank for helping me realize my true passion. Since then, I have been working for other companies in order to satisfy my desire for creativity and technology. I strive to continue to enhance my skills on a daily basis, and will continue to search for exciting opportunities!</p>

                            <p>I also recently started to pick up the violin again, which has been pretty fun! On nice days, you can catch me skateboarding around the city, or at the beach!</p>

Julianna was the bridge between teams balancing product development pace and communication. She also made a stunning design in unreasonable time contraints. Thanks Julianna."</p>
